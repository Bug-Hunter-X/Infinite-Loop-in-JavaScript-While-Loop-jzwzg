This repository contains a simple JavaScript program that demonstrates a common error: an infinite loop in a while loop. The bug occurs because the loop condition `i < arr.length` is checked before the array's length is updated. If `arr` is initially empty or if elements are removed from the array such that the length becomes zero inside the loop, the condition `i < arr.length` will always remain true leading to an infinite loop.  The solution demonstrates how to modify the code to avoid the infinite loop by using a proper condition and error handling.
